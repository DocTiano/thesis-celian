## Navigation Flow

### Unauthenticated User Flow:
1. `pages/unauth/home.html` (landing page)
2. `pages/unauth/home-products.html` (browse products)
3. `auth/login.html` or `auth/register.html` (authentication)
4. After login â†’ Redirect to authenticated user flow

### Authenticated User Flow:
1. `pages/auth-user/index.html` (main dashboard)
2. `pages/auth-user/products.html` (product catalog)
3. `pages/product-details/product.html` (product details)
4. `pages/auth-user/cart.html` (shopping cart)
5. `pages/payment/checkout/checkout.html` (checkout)
6. `pages/account/` (account management)
7. `pages/chat/` (messaging)

## Key Linking Principles

### Relative Path Structure
- From `pages/unauth/`: Use `../../` to reach root assets
- From `pages/auth-user/`: Use `../../` to reach root assets
- From `pages/[category]/`: Use `../` to reach other page categories
- All script references use proper relative paths for GitHub deployment compatibility

### Cross-References
- Unauthenticated pages link to `auth/` for login/register
- Authenticated pages link to `pages/` subdirectories
- Product links always point to `pages/product-details/product.html`
- Category links point to respective `pages/categories/` files

## Deployment Considerations
- All paths are relative to ensure compatibility with both local development and GitHub Pages
- No absolute paths or localhost references
- Script modules use proper import/export structure
- CSS and image paths are consistent across all files

## Future Laravel Integration
- Category pages will be dynamically generated (currently only `agricultural.html` exists as example)
- User authentication state will be managed server-side
- File organization supports both static and dynamic content
